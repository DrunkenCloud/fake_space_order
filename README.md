# Fake Space Order

This is my first project in a series of project from this article https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html which I got from a primeagen stream lol.

## What is it? How to  play?

Fake Space Order is a simple single player game. People with a keen eye and similar anime background will notice I took heavy insipiration from the name Fate Grand Order.

The game itself is simple. You control Fou with WASD. Fou can shoot shadow balls every 2 seconds using SPACEBAR.

The targets are Soul Eaters from FGO. They vibrate a bit and move from top to bottom and then go back to the top and repeat. You loose if any soul eater collied with Fou. Fou's shadow ball can kill Soul Eaters and this act gives you points.

Soul Eaters spawn every 1.5 seconds so realistically speaking, you while you kill them you also have to dodge to get a high score. Quite a simple system indeed. I might add things in the future if I get the mood for it.
